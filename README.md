# **ProteinStructureFetch**

This extension allows you to fetch protein structures from
[AlphaFold DB](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) to explore them on the VRNetzer platform.
This extension is built around the Python module [vrprot](https://test.pypi.org/project/vrprot/0.0.6/).
As [vrprot](https://test.pypi.org/project/vrprot/0.0.6/) uses [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html)
it is mandatory to install it before using this extension.

## **Installation**

1. Download and install the latest version of [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html).
2. Add the `ProteinStructureFetch` directory to your VRNetzer backend directory. The directory should be located at `"extensions/ProteinStructureFetch"`.
3. Before the line:
   ```
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   add the following line to the VRNetzer backend's `build and run` script (Windows: `buildandRUN.ps`, Linux: `linux_buildandrun.sh`, Mac: `mac_buildandrun.sh`) :
   ```
   python -m pip install -r extensions/StringEx/requirements.txt
   ```
   It should now look something like this:
   ```
   python -m pip install -r extensions/StringEx/requirements.txt
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Automatically fetch structures**

---

If you are in the VR of the VRNetzer and the network you are exploring is a PPI, you can select a node label. On the node panel, you'll see a second tab:

By selecting a protein structure in the dropdown menu, a fetching process is started in the background. If the structure has not yet been processed beforehand, the extension will fetch the structure from the AlphaFold DB and process it. This process takes some seconds. After the process is finished, the structure should be shown if you select the protein structure once more in the dropdown menu.

### **Manually fetch structures**

---

To manually fetch a certain structure, you can navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/fetch (Windows/Linux)

http://localhost:3000/vrprot/fetch (MacOS)

You define the protein structure you want to fetch by adding:

`?id=<PDB_ID>`to the URL.

For example, to fetch the structure with the PDB ID `P68871`, you would navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/fetch?id=P68871

Furthermore, you can define the mode in which the structure will be preprocessed in ChimarX by adding `&mode=<MODE>` to the URL.

To get a list of available modes you navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/fetch?id=P68871&mode=help

---

### **Fetch all structures of a project**

---

To fetch all structures of a project, you can navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/project (Windows/Linux)

http://localhost:3000/vrprot/project (MacOS).

You define the project you want to fetch by adding:

`?id=<PROJECT_NAME>`to the URL.

For example, to fetch
the project with the project name `my_project`, you would navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/project?project=my_project

---

### Fetch a list of structures

---

To fetch a list of structures, you can navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/list (Windows/Linux)

http://localhost:3000/vrprot/list (MacOS).

You define the list of structures by adding:

`?ids=<PDB_ID_1>,<PDB_ID_2>,...` to the URL.

For example, to fetch the structures with the PDB IDs `P68871` and `P68872`, you would navigate to:

http://localhost:5000/vrprot/list?ids=P68871,P68872
